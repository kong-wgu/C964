It ulitized the following tech stack:
  - Node JS with Express JS
  - Python and Machine Learning libraries (Built on virtual dependencies to avoid global dependency crashes)
  - Creating API logic to handle incoming and outcoming data request. Working hand to hand with formatting Machine Learning to run for computation.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
